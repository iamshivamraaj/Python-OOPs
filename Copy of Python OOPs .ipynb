Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n"," - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (called the child or subclass) can inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (called the parent or superclass).

What is polymorphism in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is the ability of different classes to provide a common interface for different types of objects.

How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n"," - Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting access to certain attributes and methods of a class, and allowing controlled access through public methods (getters and setters). This helps to hide the internal state of an object and ensures that the object's state is only modified in a controlled way.\n","\n","Key points:\n","Private attributes: By convention, attributes with a single or double underscore (e.g., _attribute, __attribute) are considered private, meaning they should not be accessed directly from outside the class.\n","Getter and Setter methods: Public methods can be used to access or modify private attributes."],"metadata":{"id":"-HpzRVS5kyWn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.

How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n"," - Polymorphism in Python allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance.

What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n"," - Method chaining in Python is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object, one after another, in a single line of code.
